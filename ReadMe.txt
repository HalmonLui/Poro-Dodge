About the project:
Code was in Python3. 

The PyGame library was used to implement the controls and the game main event loop.

Main event loop includes:
Hitbox implementation for the Poro, the cookies, and the rockets
Score and highscore counter
Speed incrementing for the Poro and the rockets

The game was ported to a .exe file using cx_Freeze. 

Images for the game were taken off of the internet from free to distribute sources. 
These images were then digitally altered for opacity, size, and orientation.
